Hi, I am an interdisciplinary PhD researcher ðŸ•µ in (labour) economics and sociology at Ghent University and Vrije Universiteit Brussel. My present work focuses on the determinants of and contextual factors contributing to (ethnic) hiring discrimination. I have previously worked in consulting on data governance and data analytics projects. Besides, I have obtained a master's degree in industrial and organisational psychology and a business degree in management.

I am a sucker for everything related to R (ggplot, Shiny, Xaringan...), my favourite environment for statistical computing ðŸ’». Not an expert, by far, but getting there, slowly but steadily. This web space is partly dedicated to showcasing some of the work I have produced in R. Make sure to check it out in the tabs above!
